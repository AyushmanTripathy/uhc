UHC, the useful html compiler, for when you don't need a javascript framework.

why?

- importing components

```html
<import path="./component.html" foo="bar" />
```

- variables

```html
<p>hello ${foo}</p>
```

- routing made easy.
- no need to involve npm, just install uhc globally.
- don't waste time on multiple configs just one, uhc.config.json.
- install just one package, no need to manage plugins.
- sass && postcss support.
- `/**/` comments
